# dwideals
An ideas (motivations or goals) system to replace the default Dungeon World alignment system.

How to use this project
-----------------------

1. Print out the the updated player sheets (this updates the alignment section of the character sheets and the cleric spell "Detect Alignment").
2. Print out the list of ideals.  Feel free to remove ideals you don't like from the list, or add ones you think are missing.
  
Character creation
------------------
Replace step #9 "Choose Alignment" with "Choose Ideal".  Characters should feel free to pick from any ideal on the list, even though some ideals are better suited for some classes than others.
  
Changing ideals
---------------
Just like alignments, players should feel free to update their ideals as a result of changes in how their characters relate to the world.

Design principles
-----------------
 - Players are free to pick any ideal.
 - Players are free to update their ideals.
 - An ideal should have a trigger that, assuming the player focuses on their ideal, they can acheive roughly about 90% of the time.
 - An ideal should not be basically a rewording of the three end of session goals (learn something new, overcome notable
 monster, loot a memorable treasure).
 - An ideal should trigger as a result of the player going out of their way to describe what and why their character is doing what they are doing.  It should not trigger as a result of them doing what they would be doing anyways.
 - There is some room for variability in the difficulty of the ideals, some ideals will be tougher or easier, and this
 difficulty will be partially effected by the player's class.
